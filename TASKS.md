# I.O.R.A. Personal Project Development Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed tasks required to build the Intelligent Oracle Rust Assistant (I.O.R.A.) as a comprehensive personal project. I.O.R.A. is a Rust-based CLI tool that fetches real-world data, augments it with RAG for context, analyzes it using the Gemini API for insights, and feeds the results as an oracle to a Solana smart contract on Devnet.

**Current Status**: Project in development with core functionality implemented and tested.
**Target**: Fully functional AI-Web3 oracle system with comprehensive testing, monitoring, and production-ready deployment capabilities.
