# Feature Specification: Expose IORA as a Coral MCP Agent (Studio + Registry ready)

**Feature Branch**: `002-expose-iora-as`
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Expose IORA as a Coral MCP Agent Studio + Registry ready"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature focuses on Coral Protocol integration for Internet of Agents Hackathon
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Hackathon judges, developers using Coral Studio
   ‚Üí Actions: Connect IORA to Coral Studio, expose tools, publish to registry
   ‚Üí Data: Price data, market analysis, oracle transactions
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use MCP server, Node/TS implementation, specific tool signatures
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects are clearly specified in the detailed requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Judge opens Coral Studio ‚Üí connects to MCP server ‚Üí executes tools
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Tool responses, configuration, health status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed - spec is comprehensive
   ‚Üí No implementation details beyond what's required for MCP integration
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY - Coral Protocol integration for hackathon eligibility
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement - no specific tech details beyond MCP requirements
- üë• Written for business stakeholders - clear value proposition for hackathon judges

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Review Checklist
- **Optional sections**: Implementation details kept minimal

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a hackathon judge evaluating agent submissions, I want to connect to the IORA agent through Coral Studio, execute price analysis tools, and see real blockchain oracle updates so I can assess the quality of the multi-agent crypto analysis system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Coral Studio is running locally, **When** I connect to the IORA MCP server, **Then** I see four available tools: get_price, analyze_market, feed_oracle, and health
2. **Given** the IORA MCP server is connected, **When** I execute `get_price("BTC")`, **Then** I receive current BTC price with source and timestamp
3. **Given** market data is available, **When** I execute `analyze_market("BTC")`, **Then** I receive a market summary with trading signals and confidence score
4. **Given** Solana devnet is accessible, **When** I execute `feed_oracle("BTC")`, **Then** I receive a transaction signature confirming on-chain oracle update
5. **Given** the system is operational, **When** I execute `health()`, **Then** I receive system status including uptime and version information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when LLM provider is unavailable? ‚Üí Should timeout gracefully with clear error
- How does system handle invalid symbols? ‚Üí Should return validation error
- What if Solana network is congested? ‚Üí Should handle transaction failures gracefully
- How does system behave during API rate limits? ‚Üí Should retry or provide alternative data source

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Node.js/TypeScript MCP server that exposes IORA functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose exactly four MCP tools with specified JSON schemas
- **FR-003**: System MUST support both CLI mode (spawn IORA binary) and HTTP mode (call local endpoints)
- **FR-004**: System MUST work within Coral Studio environment and be publishable to local Registry
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide one-command Docker setup for demo purposes
- **FR-006**: System MUST return real transaction signatures for oracle feeds (or dry-run mode)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide comprehensive health status including versions and uptime
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle LLM provider selection with timeout protection
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate all inputs and provide clear error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete operations within reasonable time limits (< 2s for price queries)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MCP Tool Response**: Structured JSON responses from each tool with consistent schemas
- **Configuration**: Environment variables controlling IORA binary path, HTTP endpoints, and LLM provider
- **Health Status**: System operational data including versions, uptime, and component status
- **Oracle Transaction**: Solana transaction data with signature, slot, and confirmation status

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - focuses on MCP tool contracts
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - hackathon eligibility and demo flow
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - clear judge evaluation criteria
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all aspects specified
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - each FR has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - time limits, response schemas, error conditions
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - focuses only on MCP adapter, no core IORA changes
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - requires IORA binary or HTTP endpoints
